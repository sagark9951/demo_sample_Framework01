#When you edit a file on Windows and then try to
# use it in a system that expects LF endings (like Linux), 
#it can cause confusion. The warning is Git's way of saying,
# "Hey, Iâ€™m going to change the line endings for you next time you work with this file."

#If you want more control, you can create a file called .gitattributes in your project folder. 
#This file tells Git how to handle line endings for all files in your project.
